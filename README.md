Zoho Comments App

Hello Good Day 
I had Done the Comments App Application for which I used Spring Boot with MySql as Backend and used ReactJs as Frontend and Still one thing remaining in the code the Filter one due to some other urgent works

So to run this code you have to download the zip file from github or pull from github to ur favourite IDE, I will suggest INTELLIJ IDEA or VS code

So after downloading the code there is Backend u can run backend in 2 ways firstly go to the main file> Java> AssignmentApplication and run this file and other one is open a terminal and use this command
 mvn spring-boot:run
 
Configure the database settings as mine
username: root
password: root
and create database as assignment and then on running will create table on its on because of hibernate ddl-auto

Then comes the frontend part frontend is also in the same folder
U have to navigate to src>appfrontend and install node_modules using command npm i in terminal
Now it will be ready to run 
by using command npm run start
Always run the server first then frontend 

Thank You
If u run into problem running the application u may contact me on 9284092561
